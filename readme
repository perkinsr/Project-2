For this project, our system models a car with an automatic headlight system with user inputs to control the headlights and a light sensor to detect whether the headlights 
should be on or off based on the time of day. For the car's engine to start, the driver needs to be in their seat and press the ignition button at the same time. 
Once this is achieved, a blue LED and the two headlights will turn on when the ignition button is released, signaling that the engine is on. At this point, the potentiometer will be 
used for the user to decide if they would like to turn on the automatic headlights. Once the potentiometer has reached above a threshold value, the automatic headlights will begin 
and the sensor will start reading values that will determine if it is day or night. If the user decides that they don’t want the automatic headlights on anymore, then they will turn 
the potentiometer back to the original position and the headlights will remain on regardless of the light sensor reading. Once in the auto position, if the light sensor reads values 
that indicate that it’s daytime, then the headlights will be off after a delay of two seconds. If the sensor reads values that indicate that it’s dusk, then the headlights will turn 
on after a delay of 2 seconds. If at any point the driver leaves their seat after the ignition is turned on, nothing will change. However, if the ignition button is turned 
off at any point after it is turned on, then the headlights and the blue LED will turn off and the driver will need to get back into their seat for the ignition to start again.


Ignition Subsystem:

1. Start the engine (i.e., light the blue LED) while the driver’s seat is occupied and when the ignition button is pushed and then released.
Pass

2. Keep the engine running even if the driver should exit the vehicle.
Pass

3. When the engine is running, stop the engine when the ignition button is pushed (i.e., before the button is released).
Pass


Headlight Subsystem

4. If the engine is running, and the user selects: ON, turn on both low beam lamps; OFF, turn off all lamps.
Pass

5a. If the user selects the AUTO position: When the light level is above a “daylight” level, switch the headlights off after a delay of 2 seconds.
Pass

5b. If the user selects the AUTO position: When the light level is below a “dusk” level, switch headlights on after a delay of 1 second.
Pass

5c. If the user selects the AUTO position: When between these two levels, the headlights should hold their previous state. 
Pass

6. Turn off all headlights and the ignition light indicator when the engine is off. 
Pass
